# Algorithmic Generation of Linear Spaces and Combinatorial Structures in Incidence Geometry
(**Linear** Spaces + **Incidence** Geometry)\
\
Python tools to construct and visualize abstract linear spaces, implement algorithms to iteratively generate incidence structures, test geometric axioms, and explore group-theoretic, combinatorial, graph-theoretic, and computational connections.
